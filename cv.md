## Briefly about me

I graduated in finance and have 10+ years' experience in commercial banking. My career included various projects and responsibilities - I am not afraid of new challenges, moreover I am always looking for them. 

It happened so that I started working closely with developers as part of my project. And it determined my new hobby which I am striving to make my new career - Frontend Development.

Why frontend? Firstly, it provides an opportunity to bring any idea into digital quite quickly and see the result. Secondly, it always improves and develops. And last but not least, there are lots of interesting resources for self-education and a large community of like-minded people.
